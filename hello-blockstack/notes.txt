### Cadastre

An idea from the middle ages. A ledger that contains all the assets in a particular community.

Key principles:

1. Logically centralized, one view of state, but no central control
2. To separate the control plane from the data plane
3. A new architecture must be compatible with the old architecture. It must be able to grow without directly displacing or confronting the established powers.
4. It takes a low-entropy carrier, a carrier with no surprises, to bear high-entropy creativity and messages. (The blockchain is the low-entropy carrier.)
